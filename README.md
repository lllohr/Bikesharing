# Bikesharing: Module 14 Analysis

[Link to Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Bike_Sharing_Final/Citi_Bike_Story?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis

This analysis utilized Citi Bike data that has been released to the public. Using this data, we were able to create beautiful graphs with the help of Tableau to visualize the data in a meaningful way. We used the trip duration data, gender data, starting and ending trip data, as well as other data to make some assumptions and predictions. The purpose of this analysis was to carefully look at the data and represent it in visualizations that can compare and contrast data points. Who, for example, is Citi Bike's most likely user and/or subscriber? Which bikes are likely to need repairs? What are the hours of most usage? Are most Citi Bike users male or female? Or do we not know that information? These visualizations look at a wide range of data in a visually attractive way that illuminates key elements in a way that a CSV file cannot in its raw form. 

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

I have included an image of the dashboard on Tableau. It contains a sample of the graphs and visualizations that were created for this analysis.

![Simple Visualization of Checkout Time by All Users'](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Checkout_Time_by_Users.png)

This illustrates the peak of how long users checkout the Citi Bikes. This was the simplest of all the visualizations. 

![Bike Utiliization Visualization](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Bike_Utilization.png)

This was my favortie visualization. The bubbles in this plot show the bike utilization levels. If a bike has a higher utilization level, it will be a larger bubble. 

![Heatmap Illustrating Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Checkout_Time_by_Gender.png)

This visualization includes the checkout times for users by gender. There are three fields for gender: female, male, and unknown. This visualization shows the frequency of each gender checkout by time. 

![Checkout Time by Users](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Trips_by_Gender.png)

This visualization shows the trips by the weekday and by the hour, however, it adds the additional component of breaking down the trips by gender. It is easy to see that male users are the more frequent customers for Citibike. 

![Breakdown by Gender](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Gender_Breakdown.png)
This graph shows something similar to the Top Starting Locations graph. The primary ending locations are centralized in a particular area of the city. This is another indication that perhaps, tourist activity may account for a large proportion the rides in this city. 
The gender breakdown graph is the most clear illustration of the gender usage by male and female Citibike users. Unknown users make up the smallest proportion of users, followed by female users. Even if the unknown and female user numbers were combined, they would fall short of the male users. 

![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Top_Starting_Locations.png)

This graph shows the top starting location of all users. This graph illustrates that a significatant proportion of users start a particular location in the city. We can make some assumptions about high tourist usage of Citibike in this area. 

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Top_Ending_Locations.png)

This graph shows something similar to the Top Starting Locations graph. The primary ending locations are centralized in a particular area of the city. This is another indication that perhaps, tourist activity may account for a large proportion the rides in this city. 

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/Trips_by_Gender.png)

This visualization shows the trips by the weekday and by the hour, however, it adds the additional component of breaking down the trips by gender. It is easy to see that male users are the more frequent customers for Citibike. 

![User Trips by Weekday](https://github.com/lllohr/Bikesharing/blob/26f25b3b53ea0bd7825d8bd9b6d9e253c7662ead/images/User_Trips_by_Gender_Weekday.png)

This visualization shows each usertype: customer or subscriber. It breaks down each checkout by weekdays on the y axis. This graph further illustrates that males are both the most frequent subscribers and customers for Citibike. 

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

The biggest takeaways from this analysis is that males are the largest consumer base. While female user do utilize Citi Bike, the proportion is far larger for males. The starting and ending points seem to suggest that the use of bikes is confined to a smaller region of the city. The start and end points are very similar. There are times when the usage of the bikes is very high and times where it is very low. I think one visualization that could be performed is to determine what time the bikes are picked up from each point. Additionally, I would want to look specific landmarks that are near the start and end locations.
