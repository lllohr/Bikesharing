## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis

This analysis utilized Citi Bike data that has been released to the public. Using this data, we were able to create beautiful graphs with the help of Tableau to visualize the data in a meaningful way. We used the trip duration data, gender data, starting and ending trip data, as well as other data to make some assumptions and predictions. The purpose of this analysis was to carefully look at the data and represent it in visualizations that can compare and contrast data points. Who, for example, is Citi Bike's most likely user and/or subscriber? Which bikes are likely to need repairs? What are the hours of most usage? Are most Citi Bike users male or female? Or do we not know that information? These visualizations look at a wide range of data in a visually attractive way that illuminates key elements in a way that a CSV file cannot in its raw form. 


Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
